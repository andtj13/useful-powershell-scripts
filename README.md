Useful PowerShell scripts for life and work.


## worklog.ps1
### Description
Worklog is a PowerShell script for tracking work activities.  It outputs a csv with time (measured in minutes) and retains information about the work task (which can be a description of the task) and category (or overall project).
New entries are appended to the file, if it exists.  If the screen locks while the program is running, it stops tracking time and appends the task.


## findAuthors.ps1
### Description
FindAuthor searches a directory for files and then prints out the file names and the author/creator the file.
